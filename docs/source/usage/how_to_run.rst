Run ExaEpi
==========

In order to run a new simulation:

#. create a **new directory**, where the simulation will be run
#. make sure the ExaEpi **executable** is either copied into this directory or in your ``PATH`` `environment variable <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>`__
#. add an **inputs file** and on :ref:`HPC systems <install-hpc>` a **submission script** to the directory
#. run

.. code-block:: bash

   cd <run_directory>

   # run with an inputs file:
   mpirun -np <n_ranks> ./agent <input_file>

On an :ref:`HPC system <install-hpc>`, you would instead submit the :ref:`job script <install-hpc>` at this point, e.g. ``sbatch <submission_script>`` (SLURM on Cori/NERSC) or ``bsub <submission_script>`` (LSF on Summit/OLCF).

Inputs Parameters
=================

Runtime parameters are specified in an `inputs` file, which is required to run ExaEpi.
Example `inputs` files can be bound at `ExaEpi/examples/`. The file `inputs.default` lists all of the settings,
set to the default values where appropriate. Below, we document the runtime parameters that can be set in the inputs file.

The following are inputs for the overall simulation:

* ``agent.number_of_diseases`` (`integer`, default ``1``)
    The number of diseases to track.
* ``agent.disease_names`` (`list of strings`, default ``default00``)
    Names of the diseases; the size of the vector must be the same as ``agent.number_of_diseases``.
    If unspecified, the disease names are set as ``default00``, ``default01``, ``...``.
* ``agent.ic_type`` (`string`, default ``"census"``)
    Can be either ``census`` or ``urbanpop``.
    If ``census``, initial conditions will be read from the provided census data file.

to all the diseases can be specified as above. Any parameter that is `different for a specific disease`
can be specified as follows:

where ``[disease name]`` is any of the names specified in ``agent.disease_names`` (or the
default value), and ``[key]`` is any of the parameters listed above.

In addition to the ExaEpi inputs, there are also a number of runtime options that can be configured for AMReX itself.
Please see <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/GPU.html#inputs-parameters>`__ for more information on these options.
